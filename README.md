# Dustjs-express-engine

Dustjs-express-engine is a gulp utility for easy, isomorphic Dust.js templating.

- Bundles your [Dust.js](http://www.dustjs.com/) templates, partials, helpers, and filters for universal rendering on both the [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) server and client side.
 - Leverages the [Adaro](https://github.com/krakenjs/adaro) wrapper to support both debug mode and precompiled templates for production.
 - Can be used with [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) to automagically re-render any dust partial on the client.
